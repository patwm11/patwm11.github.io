<h1>Pat's Education!</h1>
<p>I graduated from Marshfield High School in 2016. The following fall, I went to the University of Rhode Island to pursue a degree in Marketing.
However due to financial reasons, I transferred here to UMaine and I couldn't be happier. I am still in the Maine Business school and working towards a
marketing degree and I expect to graduate as a part of the class of 2020. I really enjoy learning about the functions of business because it leads to
great real life opportunities and you never know where it can take you. With a marketing degree, I hope to work in marketing and advertising
for a big corporation like Hasbro. Click <A href="index.html">here</A> to return to the homepage!</p>
