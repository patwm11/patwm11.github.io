<h1>Pat's Family Life!</h1>
<p>I am the middle child where I live at home with my mom, dad, and 4 other siblings and my dog Murray! My oldest sister, Caroline, is 22 years
old living on her own working as a nurse in Syracuse, New York after recently graduating Le Moyne College in 2017. My older brother, Daniel
is currently a junior at UMass Amherst majoring in math and is looking to go to med school once he graduates. My younger brother Colin is
a senior at Marshfield High School, and my youngest sister Claire is a sophomore at Thayer Academy, a private school in greater Boston.
Despite the large family, we all get along very well and enjoy each other's company. Click on Murray to return to the homepage!</p>
